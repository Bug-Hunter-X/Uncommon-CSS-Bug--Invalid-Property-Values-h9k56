The CSS code contains an invalid or unexpected value for a property, which is not caught by the browser's developer tools.  For example, using an incorrect unit (like `10pxx` instead of `10px`), a misspelled property name, or an unsupported value for a specific property.  This can lead to unexpected styling or no styling at all, making it difficult to debug.
